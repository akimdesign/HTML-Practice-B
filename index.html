                The natural world relies on a diversity of organisms to keep it in balance, healthy and thriving. To
                ensure we protect and nourish this biodiversity it is imperative that we gather and disseminate
                essential knowledge that can empower people, industries and governments and help them live in harmony
                with nature.

                Biodiversity – the diversity of life on earth – is integral to a healthy and stable environment.
                Diversity of life ensures environmental resilience, provides humans with the life systems on which they
                rely and enriches life on earth. Due to human activities, the planet is currently experiencing a
                biodiversity crisis which is resulting in the loss of species and populations of species and the
                habitats that support them. In Europe, threats to biodiversity include changes in the way land and sea
                are used, pollution, overexploitation, invasive alien species and climate change - amongst many more.

            <p>The IUCN produces a range of ‘knowledge products’ that allow monitoring of the state of nature, including
                the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species TM which examines the extinction risk of species, IUCN Red List
                of Ecosystems that looks at the risk of ecosystem collapse, and the IUCN Green List of Conserved and
                Protected Areas which provides a best-practice standard for protected areas. These knowledge products
                are used to support and guide conservation action, policy-making processes and decision-making related
                to nature conservation.</p>

                        work
                        on a range of issues, guided by regional policies and strategies, like the EU Biodiversity
                        Strategy,
                        that help to better protect and promote Europe’s biodiversity and ecosystems. We do this by
                        increasing
                        the understanding of the state of nature through generating, mobilizing and transferring
                        technical
                        and
                        scientific knowledge about species and their habitats, and protected areas – a task much
